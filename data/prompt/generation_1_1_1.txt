You will receive a Indonesian legal document title and a set of top-level topics from a topic hierarchy. Your task is to identify generalizable topics within the document that can act as top-level topics in the hierarchy. If any relevant topics are missing from the provided set, please add them. Otherwise, output the existing top-level topics as identified in the document.

[Top-level topics]
{Topics}

[Examples]
Example 1: Adding "[1] Akuntan"
Document Title:
Akuntan Beregister Negara

Your response:
[1] Akuntan: Mentions the profession of accountants.

Example 2: Duplicate "[1] Pajak", returning the existing topic
Document:
Pemberian Pengurangan Pajak Bumi dan Bangunan

Your response:
[1] Pajak: Mentions tax reduction.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine topics mentioned in the document.
- The topic labels must be as GENERALIZABLE as possible. They must not be document-specific.
- The topics must reflect a SINGLE topic instead of a combination of topics.
- The new topics must have a level number, a short general label, and a topic description.
- The topics must be broad enough to accommodate future subtopics.
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations:
1. If there are already duplicates or relevant topics in the hierarchy, output those topics and stop here.
2. If the document contains no topic, return "None".
3. Otherwise, add your topic as a top-level topic. Stop here and output the added topic(s). DO NOT add any additional levels.


[Document Title]

Please ONLY return the relevant or modified topics at the top-level in the hierarchy.
