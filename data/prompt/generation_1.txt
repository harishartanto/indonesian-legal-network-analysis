You will receive a Indonesian legal document's set of keywords (separated by `;`) and a set of top-level topics from a topic hierarchy. Your task is to identify generalizable topics within the document that can act as top-level topics in the hierarchy. If any relevant topics are missing from the provided set, please add them. Otherwise, output the existing top-level topics as identified in the document.

[Top-level topics]
{Topics}

[Examples]
Example 1: Adding "[1] Nuklir"
Document's set of keywords:
Badan Tenaga Nuklir Nasional merupakan Badan Pelaksana; KEDUDUKAN, TUGAS, DAN FUNGSI; ORGANISASI; TATA KERJA; ESELON, PENGANGKATAN, DAN PEMBERHENTIAN; PENDANAAN; Susunan Organisasi; Kepala; Sekretariat Utama; Deputi Bidang Sains dan Aplikasi Teknologi Nuklir; Deputi Bidang Teknologi Energi Nuklir; Deputi Bidang Pendayagunaan Teknologi Nuklir; Unsur Pengawas; Unsur Pendukung; Unit Jaminan Mutu dan Unit Pengamanan Nuklir; Unit Pelaksana Teknis; Jabatan Fungsional

Your response:
[1] Nuklir: Refer to roles and responsibilities of the National Nuclear Energy Agency.

Example 2: Duplicate "[1] Pajak", returning the existing topic
Document's set of keywords:
Undang-Undang Ketentuan Umum dan Tata Cara Perpajakan; Undang-Undang Pajak Bumi dan Bangunan; Pajak Bumi dan Bangunan; Objek pajak PBB; Pengurangan PBB; Surat Pemberitahuan Pajak Terutang; Surat Ketetapan Pajak PBB; Surat Tagihan Pajak PBB; Kantor Pelayanan Pajak; Kantor Wilayah Direktorat Jenderal Pajak

Your response:
[1] Pajak: Refer to general tax regulations and procedures.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Determine topics mentioned in the document's set of keywords.
- The topic labels must be as GENERALIZABLE as possible. They must not be document-specific.
- The topics must reflect a SINGLE topic instead of a combination of topics.
- The new topics must have a level number, a short general label, and a topic description.
- The topics must be broad enough to accommodate future subtopics.
- The topics must be written in the following format: "[Level Number] Topic Label: Topic Description".
- The keyword that written in UPPERCASE are heading names (chapters, subchapter, etc.), so consider these keywords with a LOWER WEIGHT when determining a topic as they often do not accurately represent the document.
- The MAXIMUM amount of topics generated is 3. So, if there are more than 3 topics, return ONLY 3 most general topics and relevant to the document.
Step 2: Perform ONE of the following operations:
1. If there are already duplicates or relevant topics in the hierarchy, output those topics and stop here.
2. If the document contains no topic, return "None".
3. Otherwise, add your topic as a top-level topic. Stop here and output the added topic(s). DO NOT add any additional levels.

{Document}

Please ONLY return the relevant or modified topics at the TOP LEVEL (level-1) in the hierarchy. DO NOT include any response other than the topics.
